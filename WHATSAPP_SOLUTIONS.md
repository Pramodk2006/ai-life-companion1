# WhatsApp Integration Options

## 🔴 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

- whatsapp-web.js library is outdated and incompatible

- WhatsApp frequently blocks automation attempts

## ✅ BETTER SOLUTIONS:

### 1. WhatsApp Business API (Official - Most Reliable)

**Pros:**

- Official WhatsApp solution
- Very reliable, no blocking

**Setup:**

1. Get WhatsApp Business API access
2. Use services like Twilio, MessageBird, or 360Dialog
3. Pay per message (~$0.005-0.05 per message)

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Using Twilio WhatsApp API
const twilio = require("twilio");
const client = twilio(process.env.TWILIO_SID, process.env.TWILIO_TOKEN);

await client.messages.create({
  body: "Hey Pramod! This is your AI companion...",
  from: "whatsapp:+14155238886", // Twilio WhatsApp number
  to: "whatsapp:+919080459028",
});
```
